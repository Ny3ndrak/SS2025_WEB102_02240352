# Cloud Storage Integration Project: Professional Reflection

* NOTE: The practical work for 5 is done in Practical2_API_Design_and_Implementation_Tiktok folder and this folder is just for README.md and Reflection.md.

## Project Overview

This practical work involved enhancing our TikTok-inspired application by migrating from local file storage to cloud-based storage using Supabase. The implementation focused on improving scalability, reliability, and security for user-generated content.

## Key Implementation Highlights

### Infrastructure Modernization
- Designed and implemented cloud storage architecture using Supabase
- Created dedicated buckets for videos and thumbnails with proper access controls
- Established secure connections between frontend and cloud storage

### Development Workflow
- Configured Supabase client for both backend and frontend
- Implemented direct upload functionality from client to cloud storage
- Updated database schema to store cloud storage references
- Developed migration scripts for existing content

### Security Implementation
- Configured granular access policies for storage buckets
- Implemented proper authentication for upload operations
- Secured sensitive credentials using environment variables
- Established CDN delivery for optimized performance
